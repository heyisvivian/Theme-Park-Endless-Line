# Theme-Park-Endless-Line
Forecasting waiting times in a theme park to improve visitor experience

Right now we need to work on defining the business goals :
•⁠  ⁠Key Issues (waiting time, less customers because of the flow, bad experience)
•⁠  ⁠Key success factors (less waiting time, how do we measure this performance)
•⁠  ⁠⁠Our solutions (Forecasting, Map of the waiting lines for attractions, Other uses of Data or more)
•⁠  ⁠⁠Data Engineering : Concatenate the data, clean it and filter useless stuff + encoding
•⁠  ⁠⁠Data Analysis : start visualisations, extract insights
